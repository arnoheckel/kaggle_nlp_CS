Joss Stone has had amazing success [in the US] given that she's a UK artist,Entertainment

She should have been nominated for Best British R & B act,Entertainment
"Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but I don't think it was very 'urban' of her to sing angels with Robbie Williams",Entertainment
And doesn't that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities? It doesn't make any sense,Environment
"Why does music have to be put into a genre? It's music, you like it or you don't",Entertainment
We live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment; It therefore directly shapes what we write musically,Entertainment
Urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music,Entertainment
Why it needed a rebrand I don't know as the name is misleading,Finance

"People take these awards too seriously! Robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels",Entertainment
Him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards,Entertainment
"I think that although Robbie Williams is a good performer, that Angels isn't really that good a song",Entertainment
It certainly isn't anywhere near as good as Love Will Tear Us Apart by Joy Division or Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush,Entertainment
It's a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups,Entertainment
Whenever we have these awards it is always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best,Entertainment
"They weren't cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think",Entertainment
"Yes Angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning",Entertainment
It seems obvious to me that people who like Robbie are people who don't particularly like music all that much,Entertainment
Folks without collections; folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music,Entertainment
"Booo hisss  Angels, best song? You are kidding, right? Last five years I might be willing to accept, but 25, no way",Entertainment
No surprise about Robbie Williams considering the list,Entertainment
"Where on earth did the nominations list come from???? Compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps?? I mean, Will Young? Come on",Entertainment
"If this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up",Entertainment
I think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here,Entertainment
But can it stand up against ANYTHING by The Smiths (in particular How Soon is Now?) or anything from the Stone Roses' first album? Nope,Entertainment
"No, Because I'm not female and I'm not 10!  Ok I like Robbie and Angels is a decent song",Entertainment
But it is no way the best song of the past 25 years! The shortlist wasn't great but him winning it is a joke!  Predictable and laughable,Entertainment
Whilst Angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in Robbie's repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years,Entertainment
"But I think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list",Entertainment
There's not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling,Entertainment
"Some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but Angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song",Entertainment
Those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while Angels remains yet another pop song,Entertainment
Yes!! I think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people,Entertainment
but somebody had to win! Robbie was a deserved winner,Entertainment
Anybody who says he doesn't deserve it is jealous of his success,Entertainment
If this is the best song of the last 25 years then the British Music industry is in trouble,Entertainment

Those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer,Environment

Many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already,Technology
It is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with UK banks,Technology
"Steve Ash, from Activcard, told the BBC News website there are two parts to the process of identification",Technology

"You take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given",Technology

"It is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack, said Mr Ash",Technology

"Over the past 12 months, giants of the technology world such as Microsoft and Yahoo have sought to grab a slice of the search action",Technology
"User experience has contributed to people searching more, said Yonca Brunini of Yahoo",Technology
"As people become more familiar with the internet, they tend to spend more time online and ask more queries, she said",Technology
"The other second thing is broadband, Ms Brunini told the BBC News website",Politics
This will do to internet what colour has done to TV,Technology
"Search was always important, said Urs Holzle, Google vice-president of operations",Technology

He believes the rush to enter the desktop business is just a way of keeping up with rivals,Finance

Increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures,Technology
"Net firms are realising that it's not just about anti-virus and firewalls, said Paul King, chief security architect at Cisco",Technology
There are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres,Technology
 Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems,Technology
This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale,Environment
"Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time",Technology
"It's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site, she said",Technology
Hijacked computers are known as zombies or 'bots and collections of them are called 'bot nets,Technology
Many spammers rent out 'bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail,Technology
Most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking PCs shut off can be difficult,Environment
Often Pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen,Finance
"The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail, said Ms Capella",Finance
"We ask, as part of the service we provide, that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning",Finance
 Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up,Technology
